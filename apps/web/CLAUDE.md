## 3. Run Commands

```bash
# From apps/web/
npm install                              # local dev install (CI uses npm ci)
npm run dev                             # dev server

npm audit --audit-level=high --production  # dependency vulnerability check
npm run type-check                      # TypeScript (tsc --noEmit)
npm run lint                            # ESLint
npx prettier --write src/              # auto-format (not in CI — keep code clean locally)
npm test                                # Vitest in CI mode (same as npx vitest run)
npm run build                           # production build
```

**CI step order** (mirrors `frontend.yml`): `npm audit → type-check → lint → test → build`

### Adding shadcn/ui components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component> --yes
```

**Windows path-alias fix (already applied):** shadcn's CLI on Windows resolves `@/components/ui` as a literal `@\` directory instead of `src\`. To work around this, `components.json` uses `src/` paths (e.g. `"ui": "src/components/ui"`) so files land in the right place. Both `src/*` and `@/*` are wired as aliases in `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.app.json`, so generated `src/lib/utils` imports and hand-written `@/lib/utils` imports both resolve correctly — no manual fixup needed after `shadcn add`.

## 4. Architecture Rules

**State boundaries (never cross):**
- Server-fetched data → TanStack Query cache. Never put it in Zustand.
- Auth token, active campaign context, UI flags → Zustand. Never fetch data outside TanStack Query hooks.

**Auth token:**
- JWT access token lives in memory (Zustand `authStore`) — **never `localStorage`**.
- Refresh tokens are `httpOnly` cookies. Frontend never reads them.
- On `401`: attempt one silent refresh (`POST /auth/refresh` with `credentials: 'include'`), retry once. Redirect to login if that also returns `401`.

**Campaign role:**
- NOT in the JWT. Comes from campaign membership API response. Stored in `campaignStore.activeRole`.
- Always derive role from `useCampaignStore(s => s.activeRole)`, never from token.

**API client:** `src/api/client.ts` wraps `fetch` with auth headers and silent refresh logic. Components never call `fetch` directly — they use hooks from `src/api/`.

**Types:** `src/types/` are hand-maintained mirrors of backend DTOs. When a backend DTO changes, update the corresponding type in the same PR. TypeScript compiler is the primary drift detector.

## 5. Domain Concepts & Rules

**Diff Review (Input Mode):**
- `DiffPayload` has 4 card types: `NEW` (full profile), `EXISTING` (delta only), `UNCERTAIN` (resolution required), `ConflictCard` (non-blocking, must acknowledge)
- **UNCERTAIN cards block commit** — commit button disabled until all resolved. Backend enforces `422 UNCERTAIN_ENTITIES_PRESENT` as defence in depth (D-042).
- `CommitPayload` uses `card_decisions` + `uncertain_resolutions` + `acknowledged_conflicts` — match ARCHITECTURE.md §7.6 exactly.
- No `add` action in v1 (D-053). Do not render an "Add entity" affordance.

**Session ingestion polling:**
- `POST /sessions` returns `{ sessionId, status: 'processing' }`. Must poll `GET .../status` until `draft` or `failed`.
- `400 SUMMARY_TOO_LARGE` — show `max_tokens` field and suggest splitting summary.
- Draft recovery: if `status === 'draft'` session exists, offer "Resume" before allowing new submission (D-054, returns `409` if ignored).

**Exploration Mode:**
- Read-only for world state. No entity edit endpoints from any exploration view (D-010).
- Annotations: any member can post; immutable after creation; author or GM can delete. No edit button.
- `"Propose a change"` button: render as **disabled stub** with tooltip in v1 (D-012).
- Timeline → `useInfiniteQuery` (keyset/cursor pagination, D-055). Entity lists → `useQuery` with page param (offset pagination).

**Relations Graph:**
- Import from `@xyflow/react`, NOT `reactflow`. CSS: `@xyflow/react/dist/style.css`.
- `nodeTypes` must be defined outside the component or memoised with `useMemo`.
- No world state edits from graph interactions.

**Query Mode:**
- Synchronous — no streaming (D-052). `504 QUERY_TIMEOUT` → user-friendly message with rephrasing suggestion.
- Stateless — no Q&A history (D-058). Use component `useState` for the answer; do not cache in TanStack Query.
- Citations must render as navigable links to session detail.
- Never render answer with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — LLM output is plain text.

**Role gating:** Input Mode actions (upload, review, commit) visible only to `gm` and `editor`. `player` sees Query Mode + Exploration only.

## 6. Key Conventions

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Never edit `components/ui/` | Wrap in `components/domain/` instead |
| Feature-scoped until shared | Only move to `components/domain/` or `hooks/` when used by ≥2 features |
| All IDs are UUIDs (`string`) | Don't convert; parse timestamps at render boundary only |
| Forms use React Hook Form + shadcn Form primitives | Map API `400` `field` errors via `setError` |
| Accessibility is not optional | axe-core assertion on every component in `components/domain/` and every feature-level page |

---

## 7. Design System

**Read `docs/UX_CONSTITUTION.md` before any UI task.** It is the single source of truth for visual and interaction decisions (D-087).

### Three Absolute Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| No modals | Use `FocusedOverlay` from `components/domain/`. See `skills/ux-focused-overlay/SKILL.md` |
| No toasts | Use `InlineBanner` from `components/domain/`. See `skills/ux-inline-feedback/SKILL.md` |
| No spinners in content | Use skeletons derived from TypeScript DTOs. See `skills/ux-skeleton-crafting/SKILL.md` |

### UX Skill Triggers

- **Building a contextual action (UNCERTAIN resolution, annotation, confirm, expand)** → `ux-focused-overlay`
- **Showing feedback after a mutation or API call** → `ux-inline-feedback`
- **Adding a loading state to a data-fetching component** → `ux-skeleton-crafting`
- **Building or modifying the sidebar or mode navigation** → `ux-navigation-logic`

### Quick Design Reference

- Grid: 8pt layout, 4pt micro. Only multiples of 4px (`p-1`=4px…`p-8`=32px).
- Colors: background `slate-50`, surface `white`, border `slate-200`, accent `blue-500`.
- Radius: cards → `rounded-2xl`, buttons → `rounded-lg`, badges/icon-buttons → `rounded-full`.
- Sidebar state: Zustand `uiStore.sidebarExpanded` (persisted). Never local state.
- Tailwind v4: CSS-based `@theme {}` in `src/index.css`. No `tailwind.config.js`.
